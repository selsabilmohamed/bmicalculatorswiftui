# bmicalculatorswiftui
BMI Calculator for Swift that can use your weight (kg) and height (cm) to calculate your BMI. It outputs your BMI index and a message telling you where you are on the spectrum. 
I decided to only use SwiftUI instead of Storyboard to do only coding instead of dragging and dropping to add features.
